# FROST (Flexible Round-Optimised Schnorr Threshold signatures) Core

Base traits and types in Rust that implement ['Two-Round Threshold Schnorr Signatures with
FROST'](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-irtf-cfrg-frost/) generically for
[`Ciphersuite`] implementations.

For key generation, refer to the [`keys`] module. For round-specific
types and functions, refer to the [`round1`] and [`round2`] modules. This module
contains types and functions not directly related to key generation and the
FROST rounds.


## Status âš 

The FROST specification is not yet finalized, though no significant changes are
expected at this point. This code base has been audited by NCC. The APIs and
types in `frost-core` are subject to change during the release candidate phase,
and will follow SemVer guarantees after 1.0.0.

## Usage

`frost-core` implements the base traits and types in a generic manner, to enable top-level
implementations for different ciphersuites / curves without having to implement all of FROST from
scratch. End-users should not use `frost-core` if they want to sign and verify signatures, they
should use the crate specific to their ciphersuite/curve parameters that uses `frost-core` as a
dependency, such as [`frost_ristretto255`](../frost_ristretto255).

## Example

See ciphersuite-specific crates, e.g. [`frost_ristretto255`](../frost_ristretto255).
