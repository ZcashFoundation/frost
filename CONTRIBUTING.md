[running-and-debugging]: #running-and-debugging

See the [user documentation](https://frost.zfnd.org/user.html) for details on
how to build, run, and use the FROST Rust reference implementation.

## Bug Reports
[bug-reports]: #bug-reports

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/issues/new) on the FROST issue tracker.

## Pull Requests
[pull-requests]: #pull-requests

PRs are welcome for small and large changes, but please don't make large PRs
without coordinating with us via the [issue tracker](https://github.com/ZcashFoundation/frost/issues) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/muKwd2F83D). This helps
increase development coordination and makes PRs easier to merge. Low-effort PRs, including but not limited to fixing typos and grammatical corrections, will generally be redone by us to dissuade metric farming.

Check out the [help wanted][hw] label if you're looking for a place to get started!

FROST follows the [conventional commits][conventional] standard for the commits
merged to main. Since PRs are squashed before merging to main, the PR titles
should follow the conventional commits standard so that the merged commits
are conformant.
